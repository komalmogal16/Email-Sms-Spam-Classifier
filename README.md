# üìß Email/SMS Spam Classifier with MLOps

Welcome to the **Email/SMS Spam Classifier** repository! This project demonstrates a machine learning model designed to classify emails or SMS messages as either spam or not spam. It incorporates MLOps principles, Docker for containerization, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and deployment on Render.

## üìñ Introduction

This repository showcases an Email/SMS Spam Classification system using machine learning. The project integrates MLOps best practices with Docker for consistent environment management, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and deployment on Render for live usage.

## üß† What This Project Does

- Takes user input (email or SMS text)
- Cleans and transforms the text using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Predicts whether the message is **Spam** or **Not Spam** using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- Displays the result on a clean web interface

## üß† Machine Learning Workflow

1. Collected and cleaned the SMS Spam Collection Dataset  
2. Preprocessed text data using regular expressions and tokenization  
3. Transformed text into vectors using **TF-IDF**  
4. Trained a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier using Scikit-learn  
5. Serialized the model and vectorizer using `pickle`  
6. Built a user-friendly interface using **Flask**  
7. Created a **Dockerfile** to containerize the application  
8. Pushed the app to **GitHub** and set up **CI/CD** with **GitHub Actions**  
9. Deployed the final application on **Render**
